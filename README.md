## A command line program for reading your first iMessage conversations from your contacts

Interested to see how your long time friends / relationships started off?

Instead of scrolling up for days to load earlier iMessages, just use this command line tool.


```bash
  git clone git@github.com:CacheFactory/first_imessages.git
  npm install
  node first_messages.js
```
