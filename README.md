## A command line program for reading your first iMessage conversations from your contacts

Instead of scrolling up for days to load earlier iMessages, just use this command line tool.
Interesting to see how your long time friends / relationships started off.

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:CacheFactory/first_imessages.git
  npm install
  node first_messages.js
```
